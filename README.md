# tailwindcss-sandbox

This repository is apart of my Tailwind CSS Fundamentals Course. This sandbox environment contains 18 folders that cover different utility classes within Tailwind CSS.

## Instructions

If you're following along with me in the course, use the **tailwindcss-sandbox-starter** folder. The **tailwindcss-sandbox-finished** folder is all of the code that I cover type out in the course completed for you to look over if you want.

## Tailwind CSS Play CDN

We use Tailwind CSS's Play CDN in this environment. Typically, you don't want to use the CDN in a production environment, but since we're just learning, we'll use the CDN here to make things easier.
